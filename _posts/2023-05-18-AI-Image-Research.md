# AI Generated Image Research
In order to identify if an image ahs been generated by ai, the content of the image is less interesting than its features. This may be confusing but if we were to look at two images of a hand, on photo and one AI generated image, the content of the image, i.e. the hand, is less informative than other information like compression artifacts, solid coloring and textures. On this basis choosing a method for extracting features will be needed to effectivley approache this problem.

## Method 1: FFT
Applying an FFt to an image reveals repeating patterns. This is commanly use in jpeg compression to determine areas of the image that contain the most information and which parts can be removed.

## Method 2: Error Level Analysis
Error Level Analysis indentifies different levels of compression across the image. In a real image disrete areas of the image will have similar ELA values i.e. edges or solid colors.

The above image is faked, you can see in the ELA image(right) the faked area has a diferent value for edge areas than the res of the image.
